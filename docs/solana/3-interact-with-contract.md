# Interact with Solana Programs

## Add Your Program

To begin working with your Solana program in **_KontraxHub_**, choose one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Deploy and Interact

If you intend to deploy your Solana program to the blockchain, you must provide:

- **Solana IDL** (JSON format)
- **Solana bytecode** (`.so` file)

Navigate to [Contract Templates](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/kontraxhub/#/contract-templates) to add these artifacts.

### Method 2: Interact Only

If you only need to interact with an existing Solana program, the Solana IDL is sufficient.

Navigate to [Contract Explorer](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/kontraxhub/#/contracts) to register your program.

## Interaction Modes

**_KontraxHub_** provides two interaction modes to suit different use cases:

### Quick Mode

Quickly execute program instructions by providing the required parameters:

- **Complex parameters** (arrays, custom structs, etc.) must be provided in JSON format
- **Native parameters** (accounts, numbers, strings, etc.) can be provided as plain text

### Advanced Mode

Compose sophisticated transactions by combining your program instructions with auxiliary operations:

- Create Associated Token Accounts (ATAs)
- Wrap and unwrap SOL
- Approve SPL token transfers
- And more

Instructions within a transaction are executed in the specified order, giving you full control over transaction composition.
