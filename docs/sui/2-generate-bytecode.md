# Generate Sui Bytecode

## Build the Project

### Normal Build

If you want to simply build your Sui project during development process:

```bash
sui move build
```

Build artifacts are generated in `build/` directory:

- Compiled bytecode modules
- Source maps
- Package metadata

### Base-64 Bytecode

To get exact the Sui bytecode for further use, you need to dump it in the base-64 format:

```bash
sui move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64
```

You will get the result in the JSON format. This includes:

- `modules`: Array of compiled Move bytecode modules (base64-encoded `.mv` files)
- `dependencies`: Package dependencies (addresses of imported packages)
- `digest`: Hash of the package for verification

:::info
For Sui, you do not need to generate ABIs like other blockchain systems. Sui ABIs are included inside Sui bytecodes already.
