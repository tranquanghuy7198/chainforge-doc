# Interact with Sui Package

## Add Your Package

To begin working with your Sui package in **_ChainForge_**, choose one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Deploy and Interact

If you intend to deploy your Sui package to the blockchain, you must provide Sui bytecode of the package.

Navigate to [Contract Templates](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contract-templates) to add this.

### Method 2: Interact Only

If you only need to interact with an existing Sui package, the Sui package ID and (optional) package object IDs are required.

Navigate to [Contract Explorer](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contracts) to register your package.

## Interaction

You can quickly interact with your Sui packages by providing necessary parameters

- **Complex parameters** (arrays, custom structs, etc.) must be provided in JSON format
- **Native parameters** (object IDs, numbers, strings, etc.) can be provided as plain text

There are some special data types in Sui which need your attention:

- For Sui objects, please provide their object IDs.
- For native Sui payment (i.e. `Coin<SUI>`), please provide the desired amount. If you have enough balance to pay for this, a specific Sui Coin object will automatically be extracted from your balance based on the amount you provide.
