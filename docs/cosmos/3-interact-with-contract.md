# Interact with CosmWasm Contract

## Add Your Contract

To begin working with your CosmWasm contract in **_ChainForge_**, choose one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Deploy and Interact

If you intend to deploy your CosmWasm contract to the blockchain, you must provide:

- **CosmWasm ABI schema** (JSON format)
- **CosmWasm bytecode** (`.wasm` file)

Navigate to [Contract Templates](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contract-templates) to add these artifacts.

### Method 2: Interact Only

If you only need to interact with an existing CosmWasm contract, the CosmWasm ABI is sufficient.

Navigate to [Contract Explorer](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contracts) to register your contract.

## Interaction

You can quickly interact with your CosmWasm contracts by providing necessary parameters:

- **Complex parameters** (arrays, custom structs, etc.) must be provided in JSON format
- **Native parameters** (addresses, numbers, strings, etc.) can be provided as plain text

There are some special types in CosmWasm which need your attention:

- `Empty`: Please provide `{}` for this type.
- `Binary`: You need to provide a base-64 string representation of your data.
- Optional parameters: You can leave it blank.
