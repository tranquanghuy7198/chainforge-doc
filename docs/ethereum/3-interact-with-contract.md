# Interact with EVM Contract

## Add Your Contract

To begin working with your EVM contract in **_ChainForge_**, choose one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Deploy and Interact

If you intend to deploy your EVM contract to the blockchain, you must provide:

- **EVM ABI** (JSON array format)
- **EVM bytecode** (hexa data)

Navigate to [Contract Templates](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contract-templates) to add these artifacts.

### Method 2: Interact Only

If you only need to interact with an existing EVM contract, the EVM ABI is sufficient.

Navigate to [Contract Explorer](https://tranquanghuy7198.github.io/chainforge/#/contracts) to register your contract.

### Upgradeable Contracts

If your smart contract follows the [OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Proxy Pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/proxies), your deployment consists of two separate contracts:

- **Proxy contract** — the address that users and applications interact with.
- **Implementation contract** — the contract that contains the actual logic and functions.

When interacting with an upgradeable contract in **_ChainForge_**, ensure that you:

- Use the **ABI of the implementation contract**, since it defines the available functions and events.
- Use the **address of the proxy contract**, since all external calls are routed through the proxy to the current implementation.

This approach aligns with the OpenZeppelin standard, where the proxy delegates all function calls to the implementation while preserving your contract’s storage and state.

## Interaction

You can quickly interact with your EVM contracts by providing necessary parameters:

- **Complex parameters** (arrays, custom structs, etc.) must be provided in JSON format
- **Native parameters** (addresses, numbers, strings, etc.) can be provided as plain text

:::tip Generate default JSON format
For complex parameters, you can right-click the input field and select **Generate Default JSON** to automatically populate a default JSON structure based on the contract’s ABI. This feature allows you to quickly generate valid parameter templates without manually writing the full JSON.
